## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes to the source files in `src/`

3. Build and test your changes:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run lint
   ```

4. Test the reporter with a local Playwright project:
   ```bash
   npm link
   cd /path/to/playwright/project
   npm link @qastudio/playwright
   ```

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all source files
- Follow the existing code style
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused

### Type Safety

- Ensure all code is properly typed
- Avoid using `any` type
- Export types that users might need
- Use strict TypeScript settings

### Testing

When adding new features:

1. Add unit tests in the `tests/` directory
2. Test manually with a real Playwright project
3. Verify error handling and edge cases

### Committing Changes

1. Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

   ```
   feat: add support for custom test metadata
   fix: handle API timeout errors gracefully
   docs: update configuration examples
   ```

2. Keep commits focused on a single change
3. Reference issue numbers in commit messages when applicable

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. Push your changes to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Open a pull request on GitHub

3. Provide a clear description of:
   - What changes you made
   - Why you made them
   - Any breaking changes
   - How to test the changes

4. Wait for review and address any feedback
